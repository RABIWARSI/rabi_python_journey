# Tax Slab Calculator 🧾

This is a simple Python program that checks how much tax you need to pay based on your salary. It uses if-elif-else statements to apply different tax percentages depending on income levels.

### 💼 What It Does
- Asks for your name and salary
- Applies tax rules:
  - Above 200,000 → 15%
  - Above 150,000 → 10%
  - Above 100,000 → 5%
  - 100,000 or below → No tax

### 💡 Why I Made This
To practice real-world conditional logic and learn how income tax slabs work in programming.
